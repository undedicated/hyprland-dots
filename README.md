# this is an actively developed, work in progress hyprland config

below are some reasons why it probably wont work for you:
 - this config is spaghetti coded
 - it's tailored to my liking and system
 - i touched it so it's dying and sucks

anyway if you don't care about any of that please star fork pull request commit and everything else you can do on github thanks
